Optimizing a dynamic programming algorithm often involves making it more efficient in terms of time or space complexity. Let's take an example of optimizing the Fibonacci sequence calculation algorithm using dynamic programming in Python:

**Original Fibonacci Algorithm:**
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    else:
        return fibonacci(n - 1) + fibonacci(n - 2)
```

This is the basic, recursive implementation of the Fibonacci sequence. It has exponential time complexity and recalculates the same Fibonacci numbers multiple times.

**Optimized Fibonacci Algorithm using Dynamic Programming:**
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    
    fib = [0] * (n + 1)
    fib[1] = 1
    
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        fib[i] = fib[i - 1] + fib[i - 2]
    
    return fib[n]
```

In this optimized version, we use dynamic programming to store intermediate results in the `fib` array. This avoids redundant calculations and significantly reduces the time complexity from exponential to linear.

When optimizing a dynamic programming algorithm:

1. Identify the redundant calculations or inefficiencies in the original algorithm.
2. Find a way to store and reuse intermediate results using an array, matrix, or other data structures.
3. Implement the optimized algorithm and make sure it produces the same results as the original algorithm.
4. Test your optimized algorithm with various test cases to ensure correctness.

Optimizing dynamic programming algorithms can be a challenging and rewarding task, as it often leads to significant performance improvements, which is particularly valuable when dealing with large datasets or complex problems.
