Linear search, also known as sequential search, is a basic searching algorithm that scans through a collection of data elements one by one, from the beginning to the end, until it finds the target element or determines that the target element is not present. It's a straightforward method to locate a specific value within an unordered list, array, or other data structures.

Here's a detailed explanation of how linear search works:

**Algorithm:**
1. Start at the first element of the list.
2. Compare the current element with the target element.
3. If they match, the search is successful, and the index (or position) of the target element is returned.
4. If the current element does not match the target element, move to the next element in the list.
5. Repeat steps 2-4 until the target element is found or the end of the list is reached.
6. If the target element is not found in the entire list, return a sentinel value (e.g., -1) to indicate that the element is not present.

**Pseudocode:**
```plaintext
function linear_search(arr, target):
    for i from 0 to length(arr) - 1:
        if arr[i] == target:
            return i
    return -1
```

**Example:**
Suppose you have an unordered list of numbers and you want to find the index of the element 6:

```python
my_list = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6, 5, 3, 5]
target = 6

result = linear_search(my_list, target)
```

In this case, the linear search algorithm will iterate through the list as follows:
- Compare 3 (index 0) with 6; they don't match, so move to the next element.
- Compare 1 (index 1) with 6; no match, move to the next.
- Continue this process until the algorithm reaches 6 (index 7), which is the target element.
- The algorithm returns the index 7, indicating that the target element 6 is found at that position.

**Complexity:**
- Time Complexity: In the worst-case scenario, when the target element is at the end of the list or not present at all, linear search requires checking every element in the list, leading to a time complexity of O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.
- Space Complexity: Linear search has a constant space complexity of O(1) as it doesn't require additional memory allocation.

Linear search is straightforward and easy to implement, making it suitable for small lists or when the data is unsorted. However, for larger datasets or when performance is a concern, more efficient search algorithms like binary search or hash tables may be preferred.
