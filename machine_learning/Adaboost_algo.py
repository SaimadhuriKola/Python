AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple weak classifiers to create a strong classifier. It focuses on those training examples that are hard to classify, giving them more weight. Here's an example of how to implement AdaBoost in Python using scikit-learn:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
from sklearn.ensemble import AdaBoostClassifier
from sklearn.tree import DecisionTreeClassifier
from sklearn.datasets import make_classification
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Generate some sample data for demonstration
X, y = make_classification(n_samples=100, n_features=2, random_state=42)

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create an AdaBoost classifier with a decision tree as the base estimator
base_classifier = DecisionTreeClassifier(max_depth=1)
adaboost_classifier = AdaBoostClassifier(base_classifier, n_estimators=50, random_state=42)

# Train the AdaBoost model
adaboost_classifier.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
y_pred = adaboost_classifier.predict(X_test)

# Calculate the accuracy of the model
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print(f"Accuracy: {accuracy * 100:.2f}%")
```

#In this code:

1. We import the necessary libraries, including scikit-learn for AdaBoost.

2. We generate some sample data using the `make_classification` function from scikit-learn. In practice, you would replace this with your own dataset.

3. We split the data into training and testing sets using `train_test_split`.

4. We create an AdaBoost classifier with a decision tree as the base estimator. You can experiment with different base estimators.

5. We train the AdaBoost model using the training data.

6. We make predictions for the test data.

7. We calculate the accuracy of the model using the `accuracy_score` function from scikit-learn.

This is a basic example of how to use AdaBoost for classification. You can adjust the number of estimators, the base estimator, and other hyperparameters to suit your specific problem.
